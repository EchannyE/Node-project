 Node.js

Node.js is a powerful, open-source JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of the browser, making it possible to build scalable and high-performance server-side applications.

 Key Features

  | Feature                        | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Asynchronous I/O           | Handles multiple tasks at once without blocking execution.    |
| Single-threaded event loop | One thread handles many connections via callbacks and events. |
| Cross-platform             | Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.                           |
| npm (Node Package Manager) | Massive ecosystem of libraries and tools.                     |


| Node.js         | Traditional Servers              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Non-blocking    | Blocking (e.g., PHP/Apache)      |
| Event-driven    | Thread-based                     |
| Faster with I/O | Can struggle with concurrent I/O |


 Pros and Cons of Node.js

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fast performance (V8 engine)                      | Not ideal for CPU-intensive tasks            |
| Asynchronous and non-blocking I/O                 | Callback hell(can be mitigated with Promises/async)|
| Large ecosystem (npm)                             | Immature or unstable packages in npm         |
| Cross-platform support                            | Single-threaded (limits multi-core usage)    |
| Active and large community                        | Frequent API changes                         |
| Enables full-stack JavaScript                     | Error handling can be challenging            |
| Easy to learn for JavaScript developers           | Lacks strong typing (unless using TypeScript)|
| Excellent for real-time applications (e.g., chat) | Not ideal for CPU-intensive real-time 
| Handles many concurrent connections efficiently   | Requires careful handling of shared 
| Large ecosystem for real-time libraries (e.g., Socket.io) | Debugging real-time issues can be challenging|



Basic API Server with Node.js and Express

This project demonstrates a simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express. It supports multiple concurrent connections and provides endpoints for storing and retrieving messages, as well as simulating a slow response to test concurrency.

 Features

 GET /api/messages: Retrieve all messages.
 POST /api/messages: Add a new message.
 GET /api/slow: Simulate a slow endpoint (3-second delay) to test concurrent requests.

 How It Works

 Uses an in-memory array (`messages`) to store messages.
 Handles JSON request bodies with `express.json()` middleware.
 Supports multiple clients making requests at the same time (Express is non-blocking).

              Endpoints

 1. Get All Messages

Request:  
`GET /api/messages`

Response:  
Returns an array of all messages.
```json

[]
```

 2. Add a New Message

Request:  
`POST /api/messages`  
Body (JSON):
```json
{
  "user": "Alice",
  "text": "Hello, world!"
}
```

Response:  
Returns the created message with a timestamp.

 3. Simulate a Slow Response

Request:  
`GET /api/slow`

Response:  
Returns after 3 seconds:
```json
{
  "message": "This was a slow response."
}
```

 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install express
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```
   node basic-api.js
   ```
3. Test the API:  
   Use [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com/) to make requests to `http://localhost:4000`.

       Notes

- This implementation uses in-memory storage, so messages are lost when the server restarts.
- The `/api/slow` endpoint is useful for testing how the server handles multiple concurrent requests.
